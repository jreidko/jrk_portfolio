      After beginning my career in advertising as a traditional art director i
      was slowly drawn to the blinking lights of the internet and interactive
      media. Since that time i have started my own interactive design agency,
      Schema Studios and worked at numerous interactive and advertising
      agencies. I have worked on interactive projects for Nike, McDonaldâ€™s,
      MSNBC, American Airlines, Discover Card, Anheuser-Busch, State Farm, Dow,
      Sharpie, Boeing, KFC and many others.
