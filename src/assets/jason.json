    "description": "A BFO metal detector is a 'beat-frequency oscillator' type metal detector. This type of metal detector uses two wire coils, one which is large (detector coil) and one which is small (reference coil). The two wire coils are each connected to capacitors to create two circuits that oscillate. When everything is working correctly, the two coils, while being different sizes, are intended to have the same inductance. In use, the presence of metal near the detector coil changes it's inductance. This causes the two coils to have a different inductance, and the electronic circuit amplifies this difference and makes it audible through the speaker in the circuit. When you hear tones coming from the speaker you know there's some metal around."

If you have a spare motor and a couple of paddle switches this model may be way to turn those items into a usable bench tool. More likely, however, you might find this model instructive for basing your own design on. The attachement scheme here is a 'hat' that can be deformed to snap-fit into a matching slot on the tool head piece. I've used this to make various sanding and grinding heads that i can swap in and out as i need to."

You sorta need to put it down so you can se one hand to press the write button and then the other to tap the keys. Thoe POTR has a lever that you can actuate with your fingers while you play the keys with your thumbs. In this way you can hold the Pocket Operator and also press the write button without limiting you ability to play all the keys with your thumbs. Now that you can walk around while you shred your electro-beats, your going to wantsome way to share the insanity. The integrated phone holder points your phone right at the Pocket Operator and keeps it there so you can rock on and on while also capturing the ear soup."
